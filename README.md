# Hydra

Hydra is the slightly rewritten successor to Petra, and is the Electron application hosting the three main screens of the Protopolis and SmartXP: ProTube, the narrowcasting and the overview screen.

To run or install, simply use
```npm i && npm i electron --global``` 

Then run the application with
```electron .```
